Description
-----------

Developing frontend in fast changing environments and still deliver a delightful user experience is a big challenge. How to cope with frequent requirements changes, unstable environments and not finished/undocumented APIs?

Developing *frontend first* is one of the answers, but more concretely how?

How can production-ready features such as error-handling, loading states, handling user feedback and interactions be done before be done before connecting to a real API as part of the development process?
This talk will present a *frontend only* solution to all those problems using open-source tools that can be incrementally applied to any project.

Never again let the backend team slow you down ðŸ˜„
